# //// PROCESS ////
# 0. brief instructions appear at the top of the page with a link to the uder guide for more info
# 1. select one or more observations (type them in? drop down?)
#     -> summaries of observations are then displayed
# 2. select the date (default to today's date)
# 3. select the author (or NOT???? --  let's think this over)
# 4. enter statement:
#      -> 1st box: enter problem
#      -> 2nd box: enter population
#      -> 3rd box: enter outcome
#      -> 4th box: enter full need statement
#      -> 5th box for notes?
#    -> statement goes to sheet and information is recorded in corresonding columns
# 5. option to enter more statements with a (+) button (with a unique ID for each statement, user doesn't need to see this, honestly)
# 6. statement goes to the google sheet, no AI necessary -- user sees message "Need statement(s) recorded!)
# Other Notes:
# -> code could lay foundation for detecting and sorting problem, population, and solution rather than manual entry
# -> could the observation bot page have a widget in the right-hand sidebar for entering need satements from that page? (in case something comes up from a conversation)

# I propose copying the code over form the Add Observation page, but removing the AI components -- only entering info from the user right to the log
